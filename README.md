# Email Classifier - Spam / Ham

This project identifies whether an email is spam by analyzing its content. It checks the string tokens against a database of known spam keywords. If any match is found, the email is marked as spam; otherwise, it's considered a regular inbox message. Spam emails are either moved to a spam folder or labeled as such, while non-spam emails appear in the inbox as usual.
